# Research question, hypotheses, methdology

## 1. Process Focus

### Research Question

1. How do artists navigate the tension between sequential, narrative goals for the 2D animation and spatial goals for the 3D sculpture when creating T1MESCULPTURES?

2. What specific strategies or workflows, if any, do artists develop to integrate temporal meaning into a static physical form?

3. Which creative decisions are prioritized when the aesthetic aims of the animation and the resulting sculpture conflict?

4. How does engaging with this time-to-space translation process affect the artists' subjective experience of creative flow and time perception?

### Hypothesis

`1. When creating a single spatial object (3D sculpture) by translating a temporal sequence (2D animation), creative approaches combine and artists use neither solely a narrative-based sequential approach (focussing on the 2D animation) nor solely a form-based physical approach (focussing on the 3D sculpture), but combines both to further charge the object with meaning.`

`2. By making the passage of time tangible and mallable, the process of creating a T1MESCULPTURE, leads to a state of resynchronization for the artists.` _(-> Hartmut Rosa)_

### Methodology

Qualitative User Study
- 3-5 participants with backgrounds in animation, design, or sculpture
- making T1MESCULPTURES for ~3 weeks
- (creative) diary during the process
- interview afterward

## 2. Contextualisation Focus

### Research Question

1. How does the procedural method of T1MESCULPTURES differ from the Modernist representation of motion in works by artists like Duchamp or Boccioni?

2. What is the closest art historical contextual frame for T1MESCULPTURES and how do the statues differ from possible predecessors?

2.a. How does the concept of [indexicality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indexicality) apply to a T1MESCULPTURE, where the form is a direct trace of digital data?

3. What are the dominant aesthetic interpretations of a T1MESCULPTURE when it is presented to viewers without its generative context?

### Hypothesis

`1. T1MESCULPTURES move beyond the Modernist idea of representing motion in their artistic treatment of time, creating a new category of radical realism as their form is purely derived from their literal, underlying temporal layer and not from an abstraction to convey the sensation of time.`


`2. When viewed in isolation, T1MESCULPTURES look purely abstract. The source animation reveals their tempopral embedding, the full meaning is therefore not inherent in the form, but unlocked through contextual knowledge.` _(a T1MESCULPTURE itself needs time to present itself fully?)_

### Methodology

1. Comparative Analysis
- Visual and technical comparison of T1MESCULPTURES against key precedents
  - Modernism
  - Chronophotography
- Theoretical framework to define T1MESCULPTURES from semiotics, to philosophy and new media

2. Reception Study

- Two-stage viewer study
- 1st asked to interpret and react to sculptures in isolation
- Then shown the source animations and asked how this new information changes their perception

## Part II – Theoretical Exploration: Time as an artistic medium

### 6. Developing a Tool

- Concept and design of the interface
- Technical setup

### 7. Qualitative Study

- Methodology
